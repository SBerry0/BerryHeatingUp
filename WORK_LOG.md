It passes four of the five test cases, I wasn't really expecting it to pass the efficient large one though. |
| 1/15/25 | 6:30-7:30pm | There was a good bit of staring at the screen to try to figure out a speedup to what I had so that it would pass the final test. I first tried to change how far the program looked into the future so instead of having the for loop go until the end of the array, it would just go half the length or 3/4. That didn't work too well as it missed some of the numbers that would have resulted in a longer trend. Then I tried to use a Trie to keep track of "duplicate" trends, but the structure didn't work too well for it to end up working, and I don't think there would be THAT much of an improvement over what I have right now. |
