| 1/15/25 | 9:00-9:45am | I spent a lot of time thinking about how to figure this out in a not-so-brute-force way, but I couldn't really come up with anything so after a bit I finally started to make a recursive technique that looks through literally everything it could possibly look through. It passes four of the five test cases, I wasn't really expecting it to pass the efficient large one though. |
